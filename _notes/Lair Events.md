Moving away from some of the more wishy-washy theoretical opinion-pieces of my Gaming methodology, here’s something tangible: I call them “lair events!” Lair events are a system I like to utilize in my games to make significant battles feel a little more cinematic, unpredictable, and engaging. The basic idea is simple: Create a table before the battle of both *beneficial* and *detrimental* events, then, during combat on initiative count 0, roll on the table for a “lair event” that changes the tide of battle. 

Usually, I like to partition the number space into 1-9 for negative effects, and 10-20 for positive effects, with critical successes or failures being significant events that might completely change outlook of the fight. If a number is rerolled, it is treated as no event. Ideally, this system should create a feeling of the battle shifting back and forth, with critical success and failure holding out until the later phases of the fight as either a (balanced) dues ex machina, or a final nail in the coffin, respectively.

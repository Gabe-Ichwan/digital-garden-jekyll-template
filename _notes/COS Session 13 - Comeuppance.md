## Notes

- Ensure that voice attack audio mixed higher
- Going forward, I plan to use `callouts` to denote boxed narration. They’re a little harder to format, but easier to read out during a session, which I think is more important. 
- [[Lady of The Vale]]

## Entrance - *Cold* Open

Start the session with a discomforting lack of preamble. Describe the chilly wind. The party, fresh off their victory at the winery will be confidently making the trek to Lake Baratok.

## Challenge - Growing Unease

In this section, try to set a tone of unease and discomfort. 

- [[Surveilling Bat Swarm]]
- [[Vampiric Mist Blood Rain]]
- tower at lake Baratok, if it comes to it.

## Setback – The Tunnel

The tunnel is a completely optional event designed to traumatize the players in real life. No character will come out the other side unchanged. 

> [!scene] Scene
> The footpath goes through a stone tunnel in the side of a steep hill. The unlit tunnel recedes into darkness, making it a dark shape against the rest of the landscape. You could proceed onward through the dark tunnel, or try to navigate around through the wilderness for about 3 hexes. 

Once the characters are halfway through the tunnel, a hollow wind picks up blowing an obscuring cloud of dust. Have the characters roll initiative. Once it settles, each of the characters finds that they have been isolated from the rest of the group. Run the scenes described below. Each scene has the following common features:

### Merric

Merric’s tunnel leads to steep descending stairs leading to a cell room.

> [!scene] Scene
> Descending the stairs, you come to a cell room. A single barred window too high up to look out shines a bright ray of light on the cell’s only other occupant: a ragged looking princess with weary eyes and a dirt smeared face. On a table nearby is an empty prayerbook and a moldy piece of bread. The entrance behind you has turned to a wall of stone bricks.

Every morning, a brick in the wall slides away and deposits a moldy piece of bread on the table from a screen of roiling black tar. 

> [!scene] Scene
> ”I was wondering when some other sorry soul would wander down here…Come to rescue me, Paladin?”
> “I’m not a real princess, I’ve gathered that much.”
> “Our captors are quite sadistic unfortunately, they’ve implanted the key in my abdominal cavity.”

If Merric escapes the cell, he is incinerated by the sun, but not before glimpsing a ghastly vision:

> [!scene] Scene
> Beyond the confines of the cell is a ghastly, windswept desert and the ruins of all civilization. Scattered in sands are the dried husks of a thousand holy men who died on pilgrimage. The sun has crashed from the sky, burning blindingly and incinerating your tainted flesh with its radiance. 

If Merric refuses to kill the princess, he rots in the cell for the remainder of his years. Refusing to kill, he is condemned to inaction. One year passes, then the next and the next. Merric cannot see his reflection, but sees his hands becoming wrinkly and desiccated. Eventually, pieces of his scalp and hair begin falling out on the cell floor. Have Merric describe his mental state:

- After 25 years
- After 50 years
- After 100 years 

Eventually, he dies. 

**Helm’s Ultimatum**
If Merric turns to faith to escape, have him roll a check. If he succeeds, [[Helm Offers Redemption at a Cost]]. 

> [!scene] Scene
> The illusion of the prison dissipates onto black dust, revealing a snowcapped mountaintop basking rays of sunlight from parting clouds. Before you stands a deity in resplendent adamantine armor. Light ushers forth from the slit in his visor. 

### Evelyn - Beautiful Now

Evelyn’s tunnel takes a sharp turn to the left. 

> [!scene] Scene
> A dusty full length mirror with a wooden frame sits upright in a mossy storage room of the tunnel. It seems like the kind of dingy backroom where people cast away their unwanted belongings. Dim light from a candle on a nearby table just barely illuminates your reflection—and a glinting blade resting on the table. 

> [!scene] Scene
> From behind, you hear a voice speak:
> “Oh! you poor thing!”
> “Your face it’s… well…. it’s all wrong! “
> “Your eyes are all the wrong color, your teeth are quite too long (lifts up gums), and what kind of little girl has horns!”
> “Don’t worry though! I think I have something that can help…”

This version of Evelyn without grafted features tries to convince her to cut off her horns, pull out her teeth, and finally gouge out her tiger eyes to be replaced with a set of pretty glass ones. If Evelyn refuses, her double tells her that her friends were waiting for a chance to get rid of her and lets her “leave” the tunnel into an illusory world where she will live out the rest of her life alone.

### Lithulia - Search For Answers

Lithulia’s tunnel leads to a set of steep ascending stairs. 

> [!scene] Scene
> At the top is a vast mc-Escher esque library with floors of reflective black marble and twisting non-Euclidean bookcases, plated with amber. Sheaves of paper fly through the air like snow. Along a vast wall of this endless interior space is an enormous vault door, hundreds of feet high. 

If Lithulia reads a floating paper, read out a random note from #cos 

Strahd, a part of Lithulia’s blood and soul, can lend her aid to escape the illusion. He explains the nature of the tunnel and instructs Lithulia to focus her attains to reconstruct the illusion with her own force of will. 

If Lithulia somehow manages to open the vault, she might see a fetal version of the [[Vampyr|The Maw]] or nothing at all.

### Scarlett - One Woman Show

Scarlett’s tunnel takes a sharp turn right. 

> [!scene] Scene
> You finds herself in a backstage dressing room that smells like old leather and perfume. Clothing racks and wardrobes are filled to the brim with just about any costume you could imagine.

 Scarlett stars in a play for an audience of herself backed by a crew consisting entirely of herself. The scenes of the play consist of Scarlett having to carry out grizzly executions of herself in accordance with her chosen costume. e.g. failing a surgery if she chose a doctor. 

If scarlet concludes the play a door at the back of the theater opens revealing the bodies of her and her companions lying asleep on the floor of the tunnel.

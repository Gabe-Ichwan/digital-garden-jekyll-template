The gregarious Captain Tajiri Bolmaro, known by many as simply Captain Bolmaro or “Mango,” was the head of the minor shiprunning company Bolmaro Seaways, and the employer of a tight-knit crew of sailors. 

Bolmaro Seaways operated by contract—transporting goods between towns, private individuals, and other interested parties. Despite the captains hard-work and best efforts, the business suffered a number of setbacks over the years and struggled to make ends meet. 

When Fortune, the company’s only ship, was destroyed in-harbor by a kraken, Bolmaro was unable to recover the loss and was forced to dissolve the company. Now, he is looking for any way to pay off his debts, do right by his men, and maybe, just maybe, get another business up and running. 

## Game Details

**Bond**: “Because of me, honest men are out of jobs. I also owe large sums to some dangerous people.”
**Flaw:** “My life is a mess. It would be selfish of me to drag-down people I can’t provide for, or to accept help if I can’t pay it back.”

## Appearance

Captain Bolmaro was a towering, barrel-chested man with long dreadlocked hair and a face well-worn with smile-lines. He wielded two blades of iridescent seaglass characteristic of sailors from Nautilus.

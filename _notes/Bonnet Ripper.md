[[Amish]] romance novels, sarcastically dubbed "Bonnet Rippers", are stories revolving around Amish culture characterized by chastity, and socially acceptable forms of romance. Surprisingly, they are primarily authored by evangelical Christian Women, who tend to idealize the simplicity and chaste of the Amish lifestyle. The plots are usually resolved by a young Amish woman meeting a wholesome young man and beginning a homestead. The genre occasionally features deadly horse-and-buggy accidents.

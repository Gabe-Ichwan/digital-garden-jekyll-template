## DISCLAIMER:

I am not a trans person. I wrote this essay as an exercise in being philosophical after getting 60 pages into “Think” by Simon Blackburn and deciding I should try to dissect the perspective of the first trans-exclusionary radical feminist video that appeared in my youtube feed. If you are interested in trans issues, or this topic specifically, please read prominent trans thinkers.

## King Critical’s Video

**Premises of The Video:**

1. Some claims about reality are empirically and obviously true, while others are clearly false
2. The purpose language is to communicate about reality, so therefore a word that fails in this capacity is being used or interpreted incorrectly. If someone asks for a sandwich, giving them a hotdog might be acceptable, but giving them a pencil is clearly incorrect.
3. If we determine the need to change the definition of word, it must be accompanied by a sound argument for *why* we decide to change it.
4. The gendered signifiers of “man” and “woman” empirically and obviously pertain to sex assigned at birth, and denial of this fact could reasonably have significant negative ramifications in society, such as the erosion of feminist movements.

First, I will begin with a rough summation of the main points of the video, based on these premises. In the second portion of this essay, I will offer a rebuttal based on the third and fourth premise.

 This video characterizes the affirmation of trans identity as being predicated on the following major positions, each with a number of flaws:

1. As arbitrary self-determination that has no basis in reality, for which the reasoning is circular and therefore incoherent.
2. On “dysphoria” or negative feelings associated with their sex assigned at birth, for which we evidently do not treat as sufficient grounds to adopt a new identity in other cases, for example someone being dissatisfied with their race. This argument is also flawed in the idea that one can claim to “feel” the way a man or a woman feels, which is epistemologically shaky and gets back to the circular reasoning of the first position.
3. On the convincingness of a trans person person’s masculine or feminine presentation, for which identifying them as such has social utility, but ignores important practical realities such as assigned sex and their potential early socialization according to said assigned sex. 
4. On the notion that language is a social construct only meant to maximize human happiness and should therefore affirm trans identity, for which it can be argued that language must also serve the purpose of representing reality. Also, many trans people seek affirmation on the basis of genuine recognition of their gender, and not just pity.

The video refutes claims to trans identity by pointing out the flaws in these common lines of reasoning, and in its place appeals to assigned sex as the basis for understanding gender, on the grounds that hunter-gatherer societies, the suffragette movement, and patriarchy, were all fundamentally centered around assigned sex, and did not center anyone simply “claiming” to be of another gender, therefore, it supposes—the gendered signifiers of “man” and “woman” must empirically and obviously pertain to sex assigned at birth. The video highlights that, if we base our affirmation of trans identity on these grounds, we are prone to making dangerous judgements. 

Before I offer an alternative basis for trans affirmation that overcomes these logical failings, I would like to refute the the notion that affirming trans identity, in any capacity, ever meaningfully causes such dangerous judgements. Two of the main perspectives from TERFS are that trans affirmation in general poses the following risks:

1. We might affirm someone who uses their identity for malicious purposes
2. The affirmation of trans identity may inadvertently erode the category of “woman” and thus impede feminist movements

To the first point, I contend that to live in contemporary society is to extend a certain amount of trust, based on what we can reasonably gather, that people are who they say they are. Perhaps it is for the same reason that if I told you my name was Sam, and I was a reasonable and decent guy, you would probably take me at my word, and not question whether my birth name is actually something different, or whether I am actually a conman scheming to rob you, or whether my appropriation of the label was simply a tactic to avoid capture by law enforcement agencies after I bombed a plane I boarded under a different alias. Perhaps if there was some clear, verifiable, and empirical evidence that my claims to identity were a danger to you or myself, then you might be justified in doubting me. But, in the case of the transgender identity—we *do not* see this on a meaningful scale. The commonly cited examples—such as trans women committing crimes in women’s spaces, dominating women’s sports, or regretting their transition—are isolated, rare, and simply not occurring any scale so as to meaningfully characterize the movement. 

To the second point, I also reject the claim that the affirmation of trans identity in any way *denies* the existence of past or present gender constructs in society, or that it could pose any meaningful risk of eroding the category of “woman” such as to impede Feminist movements. He does not elaborate on this point much in the video, but to me it echoes a common thread seen and refuted throughout much of feminist history—that feminism as a whole is only “for” a certain kind of woman. What we have seen with women of color, working class backgrounds, disability, is that denying them entry into feminist spaces only reinforces the notion that “womanhood” should be policed according to rigid borders. As we have seen time and time again, true solidarity comes from the recognition of shared experience with injustice, rather than a fixation on the things that divide us.

## Trust, Kindness, and Thoughtful Self Determination

Bearing these points in mind, I would offering the following alternative position:

We must affirm trans identity not on the basis of moral obligation, not out of their adherence to sexist gender stereotypes, not on the convincingness of a person’s presentation, and not on an *arbitrary* self determination, 

Instead, we affirm trans identity on the basis of trust, kindness, and a respect for a *thoughtful* self-determination—we recognize that the vast majority of trans identity stems from a good-faith desire to embody and experience aspects of a particular gender, which, in contemporary society, are often gatekept by a rote, prescriptive mapping onto assigned sex.

On the basis of kindness and respect for self-determination, we affirm trans identities for the same reason we often affirm the identity of amateur writers, golfers, and Christians, because even if they are not yet Picasso, Tiger Woods, or Jesus, we accept their self-assertion as “proof” of their identity. Because—in that spark of conviction—they lay out a path of self actualization. To affirm their identity is to share, hopefully, in their vision of self; to deny it is to deny their path to becoming, or at the very least to pessimistically antagonize it.

This gender-critical, biological essentialist perspective is flawed because it supposes that the gendered labels, unlike the supposedly more abstract labels of writer, golfer, Christian, or Sam, are based inextricably on an underlying and immutable attribute of sex, and that by affirming trans identity, we risk denying or misconstruing reality at the detriment of cisgender people.

When a trans person says “I am a woman” or “I am a man,” they are almost overwhelmingly *not* making a boldfaced zoological claim about their reproductive organs, attempting to gain an advantage in sports, or posing any meaningful risk of dissolving the concept of gender altogether. Instead, they are negotiating their place in a complex system of social roles, cultural ideals, and personal self-understanding. Denying this negotiation is not a defense of truth, but rather its collapse into a singular, prescriptive, and selectively skeptical epistemology whereby we trust the self-knowledge of some—people who claim to be a of certain religion, sexuality, or profession—while denying others.

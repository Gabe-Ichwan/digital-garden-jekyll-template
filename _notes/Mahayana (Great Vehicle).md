Mahayana, meaning ‘Great Vehicle’ is a term for a broad group of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] traditions, texts, and philosophies developed in ancient India. It’s name derives from the belief that its methodology—a more comprehensive scheme of salvation emphasizing love, humanity, and aiding others on the path—is greater than the group from which it schismatized after the death of [[Buddha]], known as Hinayana (‘lesser vehicle’) or [[Theravada]].

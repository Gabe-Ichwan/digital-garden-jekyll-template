Monotonicity refers to a function that either does not increase, OR does not decrease. A function is monotonically increasing if the line always trends upwards, possibly plateauing in some areas, but never decreases. The inverse is true of a monotonically decreasing function. Formally:

A function is monotonically increasing if:

$m \le n$ implies $f(m) \le f(n)$

A function is monotonically decreasing if:

$m \le n$ implies $f(m) \ge f(n)$

A function that is [[Strictly Increasing]] or [[Strictly Decreasing]] has the same definition as monotonicity, but can not completely plateau, the tangent line from the function must always be greater than 0.

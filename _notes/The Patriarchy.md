The Patriarchy is a social system under which positions of power are primarily held by a hierarchy of men. Not every man is powerful under Patriarchy, but the powerful are disproportionately men, and, in general, men enjoy a base level of privilege and security higher than most women. 

The heart of the patriarchy lies in strict social roles that both men and women are expected to adhere to. Under this system, Men are expected be competitive, repressed, stoic, confrontational, forceful, providing, and assertive, among other traits. Men who deviate from or fail to live up to this traditional notion of masculinity are punished.

Consequently, women suffer from violence, threats to bodily autonomy and reproductive freedoms, loss of economic opportunity, and sexual exploitation in a world of angry men. Woman are also similarly confined to narrow social roles of passivity and ingrained with an unhealthy standard of beauty and self-image. [[The Patriarchy Hurts Everyone (In Different Ways)]]. 

Most sociologists attribute the perpetuation of the patriarchy as stemming primarily from socialization, with the inherent biological differences between men and women being largely less significant. In my view, inherent biological differences may have acted as a finger on the scale which catalyzed centuries of cultural and social development that reaffirmed stark patriarchal gender roles.

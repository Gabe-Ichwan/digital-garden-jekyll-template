Freida of Bethzeran is a [[Jesus Christ|messianic]] Paladin convicted of her solemn duty to save the world from a great destruction, as foretold by her god [[Oghma, Lord of Knowledge]]. In the village of Bethzeran, Freida led a quiet, reserved, and steady life as a carpenter. Respected by the townsfolk, she kept to herself and lived with her dog, Auger. 

One night, after an evening of increasing feverishness and vertigo, Freida collapsed to the ground in a seizure, overtaken by a a profound vision. She saw divine fires of red and yellow descend from the from the heavens and into her eyes, wracking her body with pain and foretelling of a great destruction that would be the end of all things.  

Thought she has yet to fully understand the exact nature and meaning of those brief apocalyptic, glimpses, their final message was clear—a great and terrible cataclysm would take the land, condemning all its inhabitants to a fate worse than death. The only person capable of averting this fate was her, and the only way to do it was with her martyrdom. She resolved, then, that she would leave her life behind, and do whatever it took to save the world.

In her sudden collapse, Freida had left the door to her cabin Ajar. Auger, her childhood dog of impressive lifespan, had fled, likely startled by her strange behavior. 

With the weight of the world on her shoulders, Freida set out as a nomad, following the visions wherever they guided. She did not know where the journey would take her, nor how long it would last, but it did not matter; she would spend the rest of her life on this quest, and, when the time came, face her death without fear. Such was her responsibility.

## Character Details

**Race**: Human
**Class:** Paladin
**Ideal:** I am the only one who can save the world
**Bond:** I left my aging parents on bad terms, it has been years since we’ve spoken. I wish them well, but I know I may never see them again. For now, I travel, and wait as long as it takes for another of Oghma’s revelations. I wonder often what happened to my dog.
**Flaw:** I will do what these visions demand of me, no matter the pain, madness, or sorrow it costs. 

## Appearance

Freida has muddy red hair usually worn in braids. (See [[''Christ in The House of His Parents'' by John Everett Millais]]) She wore a chainmail shirt overlain with a black tabard bearing a white symbol of an eye radiating undulating lines of flame.

Her Paladin magic takes on the appearance of writhing red and yellow flame. (Like Elden Ring but also as seen in illustrations of [[Hildegard of Bingen]]) 
## Dog

Auger, originally named “Augur,” was a gift to Freida by her late parents. They had named him such as he was keenly alert dog, and they knew that such a companion would keep Freida out of danger growing up. During a period of estrangement from her parents, and in the midst of her initiation into the trade of carpentry, she decided to rename him “Auger,” after she discovered his hidden talent at digging viable post-holes and foundational trenches.

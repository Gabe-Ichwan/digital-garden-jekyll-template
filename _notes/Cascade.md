Hello, and welcome to Cascade! This is a world I’ve been working on for some time now, and am very excited to share with you. Set in present-day Washington, Cascade is an urban fantasy campaign that explores the life of the mind, using the fast-past paced and rules-light *Savage Worlds* game system. Below is a brief intro to the setting, as well as some pointers to begin making your character!
## Mind Over Matter

Imagine floating high above the world is a vast sheet. Atop this sheet is the place where thoughts live—where they are given shape and character. When the weight upon this sheet grows heavy, thoughts can spill down into our world.

In the cognitive realm, perception shapes reality. There, the net total of all thought afforded to a particular concept coalesces to define that concept’s form and qualities. Since a large portion of cognition is fundamentally based on the qualities of the physical world, the cognitive realm generally appears as its loose mirror—with some notable exceptions.

When ideation of a particularly vast or obsessive nature is fixated on a particular concept, this power profoundly transforms the cognitive realm—instantiating a concept that previously had no form, or dramatically altering its existing locus. When the power of ideation is strong enough, the sheet between worlds can be broken, causing a thought, or many thoughts, to spill down into the material. This effect is known as a “cascade.”

## [[Muse|Muses]] and [[Aspect|Aspects]]

By conceiving of a detailed, personally-significant, and compelling patron, it is possible for humans to create **muses** that mediate access to the cognitive realm, channeling them a small fraction of its power. These humans, known as **mentalists**, are thus capable of wielding a wide variety of supernatural abilities. 

A mentalist’s muse often changes in temperament and appearance over the course of their life, as those ideals and aesthetics which compel them change with experience, insight, and struggle. When a person becomes very wise, their muse tends to solidify into a more permanent form, changing less frequently.

With the help of their muse, each mentalist is capable of selecting and channeling power through a particular theme, known as an “aspect,” which defines the nature and scope of their abilities. Those aspects which are more archetypical and mythologically rich are more powerful, but require a more developed muse to wield.

For example, the aspects of destruction, love, sword, mirror, and king are all extremely potent channels, requiring a strong connection to a mature muse. Meanwhile, aspects such as fiscal quarter, traffic cone, or USB flash drive can be wielded with relative ease, but are much more limited in their utility.

A novice mentalist often wields an aspect meaningful enough to provide varied utility, yet not more primordial or popular than their current muse can channel. Since any tangible concept can be the basis for an aspect, they are virtually limitless in number, though mentalists tend to favor certain aspects over others for their function or style. 

## The World

Set in the modern day, Mentalists are few and far between, and have so far managed to exist safely outside of widespread public attention. This is due in large part to the fact that all [[Mental Matter]] eventually decays in the material realm, leaving very little tangible evidence of the cognitive realm. 

The roads to becoming a mentalist are many, as are the lifestyles of those who draw upon mental power. Some mentalists dedicate their lives to fighting corruption or protecting the world from the impact of cascades, while others subtly employ their abilities to gain an edge in everyday life. Of course, there are also some who utilize their powers for evil—wielding their aspects to enrich themselves, commit great atrocities, and evade capture. In this world, a person limited only by what they can conceive of. 

## Character Prerequisites

Your character will be a mentalist, either established or unrealized, that is currently visiting, or a resident of, Roslyn Washington. Besides that, anything goes! Get creative with your background, aspect, muse, magic flavor, faction, or anything else you might want. I designed this system with a focus on player stories, and have intentionally left certain aspects of the worldbuilding unexplored to allow for player contributions. I welcome expansions to the magic system, new factions, races, or anything else you’d like to contribute!

Below is a rough example of what a character for this campaign could look like. We can decide at the start of the campaign whether we would like to have muses played by me, the GM, or by their respective players. In either case, pick a dynamic that you think would be fun! Also, remember that the more popular an aspect is, the more powerful your character must be to wield it.

When Henry is called upon to fight the creatures of the cognitive realm, he wields the pillar aspect through his muse—the eminent Dispatcher Allen—to make quick work of them.

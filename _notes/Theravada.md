Theravada ‘School of The Elders’ or Hinayana is the oldest existing school of [[Buddhism]]. While Theravada does contain teachings on compassion, it tends to be more focused on **individual** liberation. The term “Hinayana” meaning “lesser vehicle” was a term applied to the school by the later followers of [[Mahayana (Great Vehicle)]] and is sometimes considered dismissive. Thus, it’s followers prefer the name Theravada, or “Way of The Elders.”
